"In general, any markdown files in the content folder that are not used in generating the site should be considered unnecessary. This could include drafts of pages that were not published, placeholder pages for future content that was never written or abandoned, or duplicate pages that have been superseded by newer versions. It is generally good practice to periodically review the contents of the content folder and remove any files that are no longer needed."
